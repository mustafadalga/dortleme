## Introduction
* Initially sold under the Connect Four (Four-In-A-Row) trademark by Milton Bradley in 1974.
* Versions of different dimensions exist.
* This game is developed according to a 6 X 8 version.
* It's a two-player intelligence game.


## Goal
* The aim is to line up your 4 pieces consecutively horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
 
## Features
* Player colors consist of two colors, red and green.
* The player who first enters the game is defined as red, the other player is defined as green.
* The game board is a 6 X 8 board with 6 rows and 8 columns.
* The total number of possible moves is 6 X 8 = 48.

## How to Play ?
* In the moves made, the stones are dropped into the column selected from the game board.
* The stones fall to the lowest row they can descend from the column. With such moves made, the rows and columns start to fill from bottom to top.

## How to Win ?
* The first player who brings 4 stones of the same color horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in a row wins the game.
* Each won game earns the player 10 points.
* If all stones are placed but the players could not consecutively arrange 4 stones of their own color, no team earns points and the game ends in a draw.

## Strategies
* To be able to win the game, you must set a game plan considering your opponent's moves.
* While applying our own plan, we must pay attention to the moves of the opponent.
* Strategies should be developed to disrupt the opponent's game.

## Restrictions
* For the first entry to the game, a 1-minute waiting time has been set for the user to wait for the opponent. If the opposing player does not join the game within 1 minute, the player who first enters the game wins.
* A 2-minute waiting period has been set for players to make their moves. If the active player does not make a move at the end of the 2-minute waiting period, the move passes to the opposing player.
* A player who doesn't make a move when it's their turn 3 times throughout a game, loses the game and the game ends.
* A player who leaves the game during the game, forfeits and loses the game.
* If the first player to enter the game leaves the game before the opposing player arrives, the active game is deleted for both sides and the game ends.
